## Real-World Production Testing

This tool has been extensively tested in production network environments:

- **Network Discovery** - Successfully discovered previously unknown fluttering ports on production switches that were causing intermittent connectivity issues
- **Zero Downtime** - Managed multiple switches in live production networks without causing any network disruptions or outages
- **Time Savings** - Automated SSH configuration reduced switch setup time from 15-20 minutes to under 2 minutes
- **Reliability** - Zero incidents during production deployments across multiple network devices
- **USB-to-Serial Compatibility** - Tested with FTDI FT232R/FT232H, Prolific PL2303, Silicon Labs CP2102/CP2104, and CH340 adapters
- **Switch Compatibility** - Validated on Cisco Catalyst 2960/3560/3750 and Aruba 2530/2930 series switches

The tool has proven itself reliable enough for production network management tasks without requiring a separate lab environment for testing.
